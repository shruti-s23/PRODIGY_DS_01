## Overview
This project aims to visualize the distribution of literacy rates across different countries over the years using Tableau. The dataset, originally named `api.csv`, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/literacy), which contained literacy rates for different countries spanning multiple years. 
However, the dataset had anomalies, including double decimal points and values exceeding 100, which were cleaned using Python in a Jupyter notebook. The cleaned dataset was then saved as `api-2.csv` and uploaded to Tableau for visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset `api.csv` consists of literacy rates for different countries recorded over several years. Each row represents a country, and the columns include the country name, country code, year, and literacy rate.

## Cleaning Process
To ensure data integrity and accuracy, the dataset underwent a cleaning process to address anomalies such as double decimal points and values exceeding 100. Python was used in a Jupyter notebook to perform the data cleaning tasks, resulting in the creation of the cleaned dataset `api-2.csv`.

## Visualization
Using Tableau, we created a bar graph to visualize the distribution of literacy rates across countries over time. The bar graph provides an intuitive representation of how literacy rates have evolved across different regions and years.

## How to Use
1. **Accessing the Dataset**: The cleaned dataset `api-2.csv` can be accessed in the repository.
2. **Data Cleaning**: If you wish to replicate the data cleaning process, refer to the Jupyter notebook file named `TASK01.ipynb` provided in the repository.
3. **Visualization**: The Tableau visualization of the literacy rates distribution is available in the Tableau file, in a packaged workbook, named `Sheet 1.twbx` provided in the repository.
